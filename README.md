# Anilist to MAL
Anilist to MAL is a simple python tool that lets you export your anime list from [AniList](https://anilist.co) to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net).

**PLEASE NOTE** i don't really maintain this anymore! i haven't updated it in ages, so i don't even know if it still works. feel free to make forks and pull requests, and i'll get to issues as they come, but i'm not really actively checking for issues or anything.

## Changes of this fork

* This version allows to export a **specific list** (with -l option) created in your Anilist profile in order to export only the contents of this list and not full list. (Only implemented for XML format)

## Usage
This app requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Python Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

Install Python Requests with `pip3 install requests`.

Once both are installed, run the app with `python3 main.py` and follow the instructions!

### Arguments
In addition to the step-by-step method, you can pass some arguments to the script.

- `-f`: set filetype (default `xml`)
  - options: `xml`, `txt`
  - txt will generate a markdown-compatible list format text file
- `-u`: set username (default `''`)
- `-t`: set list type (default `''`)
  - options: `anime`, `manga`
- `-n`: takes one argument, set the file name to be exported to

- `-s`: takes zero arguments, run in silent mode (no non-essential prints)
- `-p`: takes zero arguments, show progress while running

- `-l`: select a specific list to export of your profile (default `''`)
